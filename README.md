NHtmlUnit is a .NET wrapper of [HtmlUnit][htmlunit]; a "GUI-less browser for
Java programs".

## Introduction1

We really like the HtmlUnit project, which enables headless web testing without
needing to have a complete browser running. By using [IKVM][ikvm] it is possible
to convert the HtmlUnit Java library for use on Microsoft's .NET platform.

However, it doesn't feel very natural to use a Java library in a .NET language,
and therefore we created an HtmlUnit wrapper written in C#, so you can write
tests for your web pages in clean C# code (or any code running on the .NET
platform).

## Downloading NHtmlUnit

The recommended way to [download NHtmlUnit][nuget] is through its NuGet package.
If you want to build it yourself, read the next section.

## Building NHtmlUnit

If you want to build your own version of NHtmlUnit, you can use MSBuild or
Visual Studio 2010 or newer.

After building you can find `NHtmlUnit.dll` plus its dependencies here:

* `app\NHtmlUnit\bin\Debug`
* `app\NHtmlUnit\bin\Release`

## Usage

For now there is no manual or API reference written for NHtmlUnit. You can
however use the [HtmlUnit reference][reference], as this wrapper almost
completely reflects the original API.

The difference is that Java iterators, lists and collections are exposed as
their .NET-friendly counterparts (`IEnumerable`, `IList` and `ICollection`). In
addition, properties are "real" .NET properties, so `obj.getSomething()` and
`obj.setSomething()` is exposed as `obj.Something` with a public getter and
setter.

## NHtmlUnitGenerator

The `NHtmlUnitGenerator` executable only needs to be run when the HtmlUnit jar
file has changed. When `NHtmlUnitGenerator` is run it will overwrite all files
in `app\NHtmlUnit\Generated`.

Note that it doesn't do anything with the project files, so if classes are added or
removed from the origin HtmlUnit jar file this will not be synchronized. You have to
manually add new files to the project.

## License

NHtmlUnit is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0, which is the same
license used for HtmlUnit.

## Technical details

NHtmlUnit has in large parts been auto-generated using the HtmlUnit jar file as
input to the excellent [IKVM][ikvm] project. How it is generated can be seen in
the `Make.cmd` file located inside the `lib/NHtmlUnit` folder.

Although we consider NHtmlUnit itself to be of decent quality, the
NHtmlUnitGenerator is basically a large hack.

## Future

A complete rewrite of the NHtmlUnitGenerator using [Mono.Cecil][cecil] would be
nice, although we're unsure exactly how much this would do for the final
product.
